# Performance Optimization Guidelines

This document outlines the performance optimizations implemented in the Sokay Technologies website and provides guidelines for maintaining optimal performance.

## Implemented Optimizations

1. **Code Splitting and Lazy Loading**
   - Components are dynamically imported using Next.js's `dynamic` import
   - Non-critical components are loaded only when needed
   - Suspense boundaries with fallbacks for better user experience

2. **Component Optimization**
   - Memoization of components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
   - Precomputation of class names and styles
   - Reduced prop drilling and optimized state management

3. **Image Optimization**
   - Script for optimizing images (`npm run optimize-images`)
   - Using Next.js Image component with proper sizing and formats
   - WebP and AVIF format support for modern browsers

4. **Build Configuration**
   - Optimized Next.js configuration for production builds
   - SWC minification for faster builds
   - CSS optimization in production

5. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Built-in performance monitor for development (press Ctrl+Shift+P to toggle)
   - Tracking of Core Web Vitals metrics (LCP, FID, CLS)
   - Visual indicators for performance issues

## Performance Best Practices

### Images

1. **Always use the Next.js Image component**
   ```jsx
   import Image from 'next/image';
   
   // Good - optimized image with proper dimensions
   <Image 
     src="/images/products/product.jpg" 
     alt="Product" 
     width={300} 
     height={300} 
     quality={85}
   />
   
   // Bad - unoptimized image
   <img src="/images/products/product.jpg" alt="Product" />
   ```

2. **Set the `priority` prop for above-the-fold images**
   ```jsx
   <Image 
     src="/images/hero.jpg" 
     alt="Hero" 
     width={1200} 
     height={600} 
     priority
   />
   ```

3. **Use proper image dimensions and aspect ratios**
   - Don't load large images and scale them down with CSS
   - Use the correct aspect ratio to avoid layout shifts

### Components

1. **Memoize complex components**
   ```jsx
   import { memo } from 'react';
   
   const MyComponent = memo(function MyComponent({ prop1, prop2 }) {
     // Component logic
   });
   ```

2. **Use dynamic imports for large components**
   ```jsx
   import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';
   
   const LargeComponent = dynamic(() => import('@/components/LargeComponent'), {
     loading: () => <div>Loading...</div>
   });
   ```

3. **Avoid unnecessary re-renders**
   - Use `useCallback` and `useMemo` for functions and computed values
   - Split large components into smaller, focused ones

### Animation and Effects

1. **Reduce animation complexity**
   - Use CSS animations where possible instead of JavaScript
   - Limit the number of animated elements on screen
   - Use `will-change` property sparingly and only when needed

2. **Optimize Framer Motion usage**
   - Use the `layout` prop judiciously
   - Avoid animating too many properties simultaneously
   - Consider using simpler animations for mobile devices

### Build and Deployment

1. **Always use production builds**
   ```bash
   npm run build:prod
   ```

2. **Monitor bundle size**
   - Review bundle analyzer reports regularly
   - Look for opportunities to reduce dependencies

3. **Use proper caching strategies**
   - Set appropriate cache headers for static assets
   - Implement stale-while-revalidate patterns for API responses

## Performance Testing

1. **Use the built-in performance monitor during development**
   - Press Ctrl+Shift+P to toggle the monitor
   - Check Core Web Vitals metrics

2. **Run Lighthouse audits regularly**
   - Aim for scores above 90 in all categories
   - Address any issues identified in the reports

3. **Test on real devices**
   - Test on low-end mobile devices
   - Test on different network conditions (3G, 4G)

## Troubleshooting Common Performance Issues

1. **Slow Initial Load**
   - Check for large JavaScript bundles
   - Optimize critical rendering path
   - Implement proper code splitting

2. **Layout Shifts**
   - Set explicit dimensions for images and media
   - Use skeleton loaders for content that loads asynchronously
   - Avoid inserting content above existing content

3. **Sluggish Animations**
   - Reduce animation complexity
   - Use hardware-accelerated properties (transform, opacity)
   - Consider reducing animation fidelity on mobile devices

4. **High Memory Usage**
   - Check for memory leaks in useEffect cleanup
   - Avoid creating new objects/arrays in render functions
   - Implement virtualization for long lists
